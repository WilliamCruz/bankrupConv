            <p>
                The Debtor represents and warrants that this Chapter 13 Plan conforms to the Model Chapter 13 Plan issued by the Standing
                Chapter 13 Trustee pursuant to L.R. 3015(a). Except as provided in Article IV of this Plan, any modifications to the text of the
                Model Plan are void and shall be given no force or effect.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Plan contains evidentiary allegations which, if not controverted, may be accepted by the Court as true without further notice
                and hearing. Creditors may not vote on this Plan but they may object to its confirmation pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1324. Any
                objections to the Debtor's proposed valuation of collateral may also be raised in the context of an objection to the Plan.
                Objections must be filed with the Court and served upon Debtor, Debtor's attorney, and Standing Chapter 13 Trustee. Absent a
                timely filed objection, the Court may confirm this Plan and grant any motions regarding the proposed valuation of collateral
                without further notice.
            </p>

            <p>
                To receive distributions from the Trustee under this Plan
                 <span class="underline bold">all creditors, including holders of secured claims, must file a proof of<br />
                 claim with the Bankruptcy Court.</span>

            <p>
                and to the Debtor's attorney at the address indicated above. Unless the Court orders otherwise after notice and hearing,
                holders of secured claims must file a proof of claim within the time limits for filing unsecured claims as set forth in
                Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002(c). A proof of claim form has been included with the notice of the Plan confirmation hearing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unless the Court orders otherwise, after notice and hearing, the Trustee shall make no distributions to any claim filed after the<br />
                time allowed for filing proofs of claim as set forth in Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002 and 3004. Following the expiration of these time<br />
                periods, the Trustee shall serve acknowledgments of filed claims and shall file and serve on the Debtor and Debtor's attorney a<br />
                notice of how he intends to pay allowed claims. Objections to the provisions for treatment of any claim as set forth in the<br />
                Trustee's claim acknowledgment or in the Trustee's Notice of Intent to Pay shall be filed with the Bankruptcy Court within thirty<br />
                (30) days of service. The objecting party shall set the objection for hearing and serve the objection on the Trustee, the Debtor,<br />
                and the Debtor's attorney. In the absence of any objection to the Trustee's claim acknowledgment or Notice of Intent to Pay, the<br />
                Debtor and other parties in interest shall be barred from later objecting to the proposed distribution of funds as set forth in these<br />
                notices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creditors may view the Debtor's bankruptcy petition, schedules and statements as well as other documents filed in the case on<br />
                the Court's website, <u>www.nvb.uscourts.gov</u> (a subscription/fee service), or at the Bankruptcy Court Clerk's office.
            </p>


            <div class="header">CONFIRMATION REQUEST AND MOTION TO VALUE COLLATERAL</div>
            <p>
                The claim amounts set forth in this Plan are based on the best information available to the Debtor. The Debtor intends that all
                claims shall be provided for based on the actual allowed amount of the claim. The projected distribution to holders of Class 6
                and Class 7 unsecured claims may be decreased without further notice and hearing to the extent the Debtor has
                underestimated the actual allowed amount of any administrative, secured and/or priority claims or to the extent the Bankruptcy
                Court approves or orders a different treatment of these claims. The Debtor submits that this Plan satisfies the requirements of
                11 U.S.C. §§ 1322 and 1325 and requests that the Court confirm this Chapter 13 Plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the extent this Plan provides for payment of any secured claim based on the value of any Secured Creditor's collateral, the
                Debtor requests that the Court determine the value of the Secured Creditor's collateral as set forth in this Plan pursuant to
                Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3012 and that the Court approve the interest rate proposed to satisfy the allowed secured claim as set forth in
                this Plan.
            </p>


            <div class="header">I. Plan Payments and Term</div>
            
                Unless the Court orders otherwise, the Effective Date of the Plan shall be the date the Debtor's bankruptcy petition was filed. In
                order to complete this Plan, all or a portion of the Debtor's projected disposable earnings shall be submitted to the supervision
                and control of the Standing Chapter 13 Trustee ("Trustee"). The Debtor's first Plan payment shall be made on or before thirty
                (30) days following the date this Plan was filed with the Court. Unless the Court orders otherwise, in no event shall the Debtor's
                first Plan payment be due more than forty-five (45) days after the Debtor's bankruptcy case was filed. In addition to the Debtor's
                regular Plan payment schedule, the Debtor shall also contribute to the Plan any income tax refunds that the Debtor may be 
                entitled to receive during the first thirty-six (36) months of the Plan. The minimum Plan base shall be
                <div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ $00.00 ]</div>. Debtor's proposed payment schedule is as follows:

            <p>
                To the extent holders of general unsecured claims will not receive full payment of their allowed claims, the Debtor represents
                and warrants that the total of the proposed Plan payments are not less than 100% of the Debtor's projected disposable earnings
                over a thirty-six (36) month period. Unless the Court orders otherwise, if unsecured claims are not paid in full, the Plan shall not
                terminate earlier than the stated term or 36 months, whichever is longer. If necessary to complete this Plan, the term may be
                extended with consent of the Trustee by stipulation and order without notice and hearing, but in no event will the Plan or any
                extension provide for payments over a period that exceeds 60 months. The proposed plan payments and/or term shall be
                subject to adjustment to complete the Plan in the event any postpetition default results in the additional accrual of interest on
                secured claims. Similarly, such an adjustment may be required as a result of an increase in the projected Trustee's Statutory
                Percentage Fee.
            </p>

            <div class="header">II. Classification and Treatment of Claims and Expenses</div>

            <p>
                The claims scheduled by the Debtor are classified and provided for below. The Trustee shall make disbursements only to
                holders of allowed claims. Unless the Court orders otherwise, a claim may be allowed only if a proof of claim form has been
                filed by or on behalf of a creditor. Accordingly, <span class="bold underline">to be paid, all creditors, including holders of secured claims, must file a proof
                of claim</span>. Unless the Court orders otherwise, after notice and hearing, claims filed after the applicable claims bar date shall
                receive no distributions under this Plan. Pending confirmation of the Plan and/or other collateral valuation hearings, the
                outcome of any lien avoidance motion or other proceeding, the proof of claim filed by or on behalf of a creditor, not the Plan or the
                Debtor's bankruptcy schedules, will determine the amount and character of the creditor's claim. If a creditor's claim is provided
                for by this Plan and a proof of claim is filed, distributions will be made based upon the filed proof of claim unless the Court
                orders otherwise in the order confirming the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan, a separate valuation hearing, a lien avoidance hearing, a
                claim objection hearing or other proceeding. If a creditor does not object to the valuation of its collateral as set forth in the Plan,
                the collateral will be valued and the allowed secured claim determined as set forth in the Plan. Secured claims not listed in
                Classes 1, 2, 3, 4, or as otherwise provided for in the Plan Confirmation Order, and priority claims not listed within Class 5 or
                otherwise provided for in the Plan Confirmation Order are not provided for by this Plan and shall not be impaired by the Plan or
                paid by the Trustee. In the event such claims are timely filed, the Debtor shall modify this Plan to provide for the claims. Whether
                or not a proof of claim is filed, the Debtor shall make the regular ongoing post-petition installment payments on Class 1 and
                Class 4 claims.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">1. Chapter 13 Trustee's fees</span> will be allowed and paid as determined by statute. The Trustee may receive up to 7.95% of the
                money received and distributed each month, excluding direct payments by the Debtor to Class 1 and Class 4 creditors and
                refunds from the Trustee to the Debtor.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">2. Administrative Expenses:</span> In most cases the only additional administrative expenses will be the Debtor's attorneys' fees.
                Attorneys' fees and other administrative expenses must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court before they can be paid. Once
                approved, an administrative expense will be paid in full before payment of Class 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 claims. Distributions to
                administrative claims may be deferred however if the Plan provides for scheduled payments to specific creditors and there are
                not sufficient funds available to also fully fund administrative claims, the Court orders otherwise, or the administrative claimant
                agrees to a different treatment. After deducting the<div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ $00.00 ]</div> pre-petition retainer,

                secured claims that will be paid in full during the Plan.</span>This class includes any secured claim that matured before the Debtor's
                bankruptcy case was filed or secured claims that will mature prior to the completion of the Debtor's Plan. It also includes any
                secured claim, regardless of its maturity date, that is modified as permitted by 11 U.S.C. §§ 1322(b)(2), (c)(2) and/or 1325(a)(5).
                Each secured claim shall continue to be secured by any existing liens or security interests and will be paid either the full amount
                of the claim or the present fair market value of the collateral that secures the claim, whichever is less. If the claim is
                undersecured, the difference between the value of the collateral and the total claim shall be paid as a Class 7 claim. If no
                interest rate is specified below to provide the creditor with the present value of its allowed secured claim, 10% per annum will be
                imputed and paid on the claim. Except as set forth below or otherwise ordered by the Court, Interest shall accrue on the allowed
                secured claim from the petition date and all secured claims shall be paid on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of the Debtor's
                Plan, the secured creditor shall release its lien on the encumbered property. To the extent the "Claim Amount" scheduled below
                or the total amount claimed by the creditor in a filed Proof of Claim is greater than the "Market Value of Collateral" scheduled
                below, the Debtor requests that the Court determine the amount of the creditor's allowed secured claim and that the Court
                determine that the fair market value of the secured creditor's collateral is as scheduled below. The Debtor further requests that
                the Court determine that the interest rate proposed below will provide the creditor with the present value of its allowed secured
                claim. To the extent the proposed treatment of any Class 2 Claim is opposed by any party in interest and the Bankruptcy Court
                does not approve the proposed treatment of the claim or a modified treatment of the claim, the Plan may nevertheless be
                confirmed if Debtor elects to surrender the Collateral to the holder of the Class 2 claim and provide for the claim as a Class 3
                claim.

                and contractual remedies to recover its collateral. If a proof of claim is timely filed by any Class 3 creditor, the claim shall be paid
                based on the terms of the proof of claim. No distributions shall be made by the Trustee on any secured portion of the claim as
                reflected in the filed proof of claim. The Class 3 creditor may amend any timely filed proof of claim within twelve (12) months
                following entry of the confirmation order to assert an unsecured deficiency claim following the disposition of the collateral under
                applicable state law. If an amended unsecured claim is filed, it shall be treated as a Class 7 claim and shall begin receiving
                pro rata distributions with other Class 7 claims not more than forty-five (45) days after the amended proof of claim is filed. The
                claim shall receive distributions on a pro rata basis with other Class 7 claims on account of any amended unsecured claim that
                may be filed. In the event an amended proof of claim is filed after the trustee has commenced distributions to holders of other
                Class 7 claims however, the Trustee shall not be required to recover distributions from holders of other unsecured creditors in
                order to provide an equal total pro rata distribution to the Class 3 claimant based on the amended claim. If the creditor fails to
                file an amended proof of claim to assert a deficiency within the twelve (12) months following confirmation of the Debtor's Plan,
                any deficiency claim greater than the amount set forth in a previously filed proof of claim shall be disallowed and discharged

                <span class="bold">Class 7. General unsecured claims.</span> General unsecured claims will be paid on a pro rata basis after all other allowed claims
                provided for in the Plan are satisfied. Based on the estimates set forth in this Plan, the Debtor projects that after payment of 
                administrative, secured and priority claims, distributions to holders of general unsecured claims, including the under
                collateralized portion of secured claims not entitled to priority, will total approximately<div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ $00.00 ]</div>. The Debtor has
                scheduled general unsecured claims totaling<div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ $00.00 ]</div>. The Debtor projects that holders of Class 7 claims will
                receive approximately<div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ ##% ]</div> of their allowed claims. The projected distribution to general unsecured creditors may
                however be reduced without further notice and hearing during the confirmation process in the event administrative, secured and
                priority claims, and/or interest rates are determined to require distributions in an amount greater than is projected in this Plan.
                Distributions may be further reduced if additional administrative expenses are awarded by the Court during the course of the
                case.
                
                The Debtor represents and warrants that the distribution in this case to general unsecured claims will equal or exceed the value
                of what general unsecured creditors would receive if the Debtor's assets were liquidated in a Chapter 7 case. The scheduled
                value of the Debtor's unencumbered nonexempt assets is<div class="underline bold center" style="width: 150px;">[ $0.00 ].</div>
                The Plan provides that at least this amount will be distributed to holders of unsecured claims. Following confirmation, the Plan shall remain subject to dismissal and/or
                modification after all allowed claims are known if the expected distribution to holders of Class 5, Class 6 and Class 7
                unsecured claims is less than the liquidation value of the Debtor's non exempt unemcumbered assets.

                The Debtor requests that the Court approve the assumption of the executory contracts and unexpired leases listed in the table
                below. The Debtor shall pay directly to the other party to the executory contract or unexpired lease all on-going post-petition
                payments. Any pre-bankruptcy arrears shall be paid in full either as a Class 1 claim or as a Class 6 claim, or as stated in the
                Additional Provisions (Article IV) below. Any executory contracts or unexpired leases not listed in the table below are rejected.

                terms and conditions of the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan. The Debtor shall disclose to the Trustee and amend the Schedules of
                Assets filed in this case to disclose any increase in property of the estate described in 11 U.S.C. § 1306(a) in which the Debtor
                obtains an interest priort to the completion of payments required by the Plan. In the event the case is converted to another
                Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code or is dismissed, property of the estate shall vest in accordance with 11 U.S.C. §§ 348(f), 349(b)

                <span class="bold">B. Debtor's Duties.</span> In addition to the duties and obligations imposed upon Debtor by the Bankruptcy Code and Rules, the
                Local Bankruptcy Court Rules, this Plan imposes the following additional requirements on Debtor:
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <span class="bold">(a) Transfers of Property and New Debt.</span> The Debtor is prohibited from transferring, encumbering, selling, or otherwise
                disposing of any nonexempt personal or real property with a value of $1,000 or more other than in the regular course of Debtor's
                financial or business affairs without first obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval. Except as provided in 11 U.S.C. §§ 364 and 1304,
                the Debtor shall not incur aggregate new debt exceeding $1,000 without first obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval. If the Trustee
                approves a proposed transfer or new debt, Court approval may be obtained by stipulation without notice and hearing. To
                determine the appropriate procedure, the Debtor should consult with the Trustee. Without full compliance with 11 U.S.C. § 1305,
                postpetition debts shall not be paid through this Plan. The plan may however be modified after confirmation by Stipulation and
                Order to provide full payment of any claim allowed under § 1305 provided that the proposed modification provides for full
                payment of the allowed postpetition claim and the modification does not alter the proposed distribution to holders of other
                allowed claims.
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">(c) Support Payments.</span> Debtor shall maintain direct ongoing child or spousal support payments to the Court-ordered recipient.

                affairs shall be conducted in accordance with applicable non-bankruptcy law. This duty includes the timely filing of tax returns and
                payment of taxes.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span class="bold">(e) Periodic Reports to the Trustee.</span> Following confirmation, the Debtor shall provide the Trustee with all federal and state
                income tax returns including any W-2 forms and 1099 forms for each tax period that ends during the first three years of the
                Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan. During the pendency of this Case, the Debtor shall provide the Trustee with any requested financial
                information or other documentation regarding Debtor's business or other financial affairs.

                claims that provided for in the Plan but exceed the projected allowed amount provided for in the Plan. After the allowed amount
                of all claims are known however, the Debtor shall be required to modify thsi Plan to cause the Plan to be feasible, to satisfy the
                best interest of creditors test, and/or to provide for any allowed administrative, secured and/or priority claims that are not
                provided for in this Plan. Failure to modify the Plan to cure such deficiencies shall be cause for dismissal.
